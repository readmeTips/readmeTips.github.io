## Create a home page auto-magically from README.md

If you are a GitHub user named %username% and create a repository at %username%.github.io and add a README.md file,
then the README file will be auto-magically be translated into HTML and it will display as HTML when you go to `https://%username%.github.io`.

This README is a good example. Go to [readmeTips.github.io]( https://readmeTips.github.io ) to see the result.
